                            <p>Intermittent fasting is the routine of fasting for 12+ hours and eating for less than 12 hours each day. By fasting for more than 12 hours a day will supercharge your metabolism, which will drive health benefits such as fat loss, increased energy and slower aging.</p>

                            <p>We understand how hard change is and that for many people shifting to a plant only diet would be difficult so we advocate a diet that actively reduces meat intake and increases plant foods intake. By improving the quality of your meat intake and reducing it, you can improve your metabolism while significantly reducing your risk of colorectal cancer and impact on the environment also.</p>

                            <p>Whole foods are foods that you buy whole and not highly processed or manufactured in factories. If it comes in lots of packaging then it's generally a bad idea. Our bodies have evolved to eat the things grown around us and not the broken down parts of them. By eating mostly whole foods you will greatly improve your physical and mental health.</p>

                            <p>Put simply diets don't work as they all focus on short term gains and not the long term change needed to hold on to all your hard work. SUSTE has been developed with sustainability at its core. By that we mean, we've done the hard work in simplifying behaviour change and will give you the step by step guidance on how to build the right habits for long-lasting health. Our habits not only benefit you but also our shared environment, which is fundamental to our safety and health.</p>

By making change easy we are empowering millions of people to improve their health and sustainability everyday. By improving yourself and helping others do the same we can drive the global change needed to avert the climate crisis.</p>
